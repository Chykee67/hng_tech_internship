This folder contains necesary files for executing the task 1 in production

DESCRIPTION

Task: Deploy a public API that returns interesting facts about a given integer number in JSON format 
and/or returns an appropriate HTTP status code

Language: Python, version 3.12.3

Framework: Django and djangorestframework

Hosting platform: render.com

Please see the requirements.txt file included in the DevOps_stage1/stage1task folder for the packages necessary to successfully execute the scripts and run the app

Note: There are, as yet, no accompanying tests for the code written for this task. However, I hope to fix that in good time (fingers crossed).


NOTABLE LEARNING POINTS

During the process of completing this project, I became more familiar with various aspects of API design using django and the djangorestframework, especially about deploying the API from a development environment to a production environment. Additionally, I became more comfortable working with Github.

Furthermore, I got to discover various options for hosting APIs online and decided to use render.com. Looking forward to exploring a little bit more with my new found skills.
